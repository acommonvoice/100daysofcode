# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 10th, 2021 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Made the commitment to start the program, started a github account and Twitter. I completed the first few lessons on freecode camp!

**Thoughts:** Everything was super simple to start, there is a coding program integrated in the website which is cool. The whole program is really well put together.

**Link to work:** All my work is in the freecodecamp website, I will share a picture as soon as I have my first certification

### Day 2: January 11th, 2021 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Made more progress on freecodecamp, probably four or five more lessons, I'm taking my time in the beginning, been busy with life things

**Thoughts**: So far so good, not too many thoughts here

**Link(s) to work**: Made it to Lesson 8 in freecodecamp

### Day 1: January 12th, 2021 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: Now I'm starting to get into the good stuff, ran into a little wall and experienced my first coding frustration, I cooled off and figured it out. Oooo this will be fun
